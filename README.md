BasicGumtreeScraper
===================

Python code to scrape Gumtree to an excel spreadsheet.

Edit the variables 'Loc', 'query' and 'category' to define your Gumtree search criteria.

loc = this is the location where you wish to search. If the location name is multiple works separate the works with a '+'. e.g. 'Merthyr+Tydfil'

query = this is the item you wish to search for. If the item name is multiple works separate the works with a '+'. e.g. 'King+Bed'

category = this is the category where you wish to search. If the category name is multiple works separate the works with a '-'. e.g. 'For+Sale'

Feel free to edit or improve upon the code.
